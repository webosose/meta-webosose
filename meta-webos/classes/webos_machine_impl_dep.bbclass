# If there are MACHINE-s with different "machine implementations" but with the
# same TUNE_PKGARCH, they will have the same package name unless PACKAGE_ARCH
# is set to MACHINE_ARCH. XXX Is there a better way to handle this?

# what's set by the machine architecture .inc file, which is checked after
# MACHINE. WEBOS_EXTRA_MACHINEOVERRIDES is deliberately assigned to and not
# appended to or prepended to so that the order of inherit statements will not
# affect the order of what's in MACHINEOVERRIDES.
