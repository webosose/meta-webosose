# nmp's cache has following structure
# package_name (folder)
#  |___package_version (1.2.3 for example)
#  |   |___package (folder named 'package') folder with unpacked package

# On upgrading node-gyp in the situation when some dependencies are not met
# npm will print something like "cannot fetch some-tarball-x.y.z".
# This means that dependecy on newer version (x.y.z) was brought.
# To fix - just go to node-gyp-packages-native.inc and point SRC_URI of mentioned
# tarball to the needed version x.y.z. Than build again. Fix checksums. Fix licenes.
#
# There is no reason to upgrade registry every time when upgrading
# node-gyp. But on some day after upgrading some node-gyp dependent package
# it can bring dependency which is not present in the registry.
# For example node-gyp contains dependency on 'abbrev'. Dependency rule looks like
# '=1.0.5' which means than node-gyp 'wants' abbrev v1.0.5. On some day we decided
# to upgrade node-gyp. And upgraded node-gyp-native contains rule '=2.0.0'. There is
# no any information about abbrev 2.0.0 in our local registry and we will get a
# strange error. And in that messages we need to search for something like:
#
#  No compatible version found: abbrev@'=2.0.0-0'
#  npm ERR! notarget Valid install targets:
#  npm ERR! notarget ["1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.5"]
#
# This meens that registry doesn't contain needed version. So we need to upgrade it
# To upgrade registry items. Untar registry folder. Open registry of needed packages using url
# https://registry.npmjs.org/<needed-package>. Replace it with new one. Than tar it and put
# into the place.
#
# Good luck :)
