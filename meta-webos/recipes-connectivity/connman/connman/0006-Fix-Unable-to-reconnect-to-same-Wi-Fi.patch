Subject: [PATCH] Set IPv6 state same as IPV4 on disconnect

:Release Notes:
This sets correct state for IPv6 state on disconnection

:Detailed Notes:
State is decided based on combined state of ipv4 and ipv6 state.
During disconnect it was set as ready because IPv6 state is ready.
Which causes a new profile creation in adapter.

Upstream-Status : Inappropriate [webOS specific]
