# An example of when an interface should be added to this list is when
# its hardware (MAC) address changes between the time when it is first
# detected by the kernel during boot and when it is first activated (say
# because during initial detection, the driver attempts to read its
# hardware address from a filesystem that has not yet been mounted).
#
# It is assumed that the state into which the kernel places an interface
# that does RF transmissions allows it to be activated legally in any
# country before any further configuration of it is done by connmand.
