Subject: [PATCH] Support wrapMode=wordWrap for QML Text type for Korean
 language

:Release Notes:
Text.WordWrap is option of wrapping sentense by word unit.
Support this option by applying customization in rule 26
by tailoring class ID to class AL.

:Detailed Notes:
By default, Qt does line breakings for Korean after each
syllable (lines can break anywhere, unless prohibited).
To disable breaking Korean text by syllables, the classes
in rule LB26, as well as characters of class ID, are often
tailored to AL.
Refer to the following document:
http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-30.html#LB27
This patch does mentioned above tailoring.

By default, Qt do line breakings for Korean after each
syllable (lines can break anywhere, unless prohibited).
To disable breaking Korean syllable, tayloring rule LB26
should be implemented. Refer to the following document:
http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-30.html

:Testing Performed:
master-865
created test application. text.WordWrap works well

Upstream-Status: Submitted

:QA Notes:

:Issues Addressed:
