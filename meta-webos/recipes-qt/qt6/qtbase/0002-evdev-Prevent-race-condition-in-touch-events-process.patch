Subject: [PATCH] evdev: Prevent race condition in touch events processing

Unlike other input devices, touch devices are managed by corresponding
handler threads which are not the main thread. InputEvent that is
inherited by TouchEvent has a constant pointer member for device, but in
touch events case, handler threads may destroy the device which is
pointed by events while processing these events in main thread,
and this may cause critical potential issues such as crash. In order to
prevent this race condition, move device of QEvdevTouchScreenHandler
into main thread and delete this device later if QGuiApplication
instance exists when handler thread quits, and check event's device is
valid when processing touch events.

+/*! \internal
+
+    QEvdevTouchScreenHandler::unregisterPointingDevice can be called by several cases.
+
+    First of all, the case that an application is terminated, and destroy all input devices
+    immediately to unregister in this case.
+
+    Secondly, the case that removing a device without touch events for the device while the
+    application is still running. In this case, the destructor of QEvdevTouchScreenHandler from
+    the connection with QDeviceDiscovery::deviceRemoved in QEvdevTouchManager calls this method.
+    And this method moves a device into the main thread and then deletes it later but there is no
+    touch events for the device so that the device would be deleted in appropriate time.
+
+    Finally, this case is similar as the second one but with touch events, that is, a device is
+    removed while touch events are given to the device and the application is still running.
+    In this case, this method is called by readData with ENODEV error and the destructor of
+    QEvdevTouchScreenHandler. So in order to prevent accessing the device which is already nullptr,
+    check the nullity of a device first. And as same as the second case, move the device into the
+    main thread and then delete it later. But in this case, cannot guarantee which event is
+    handled first since the list or queue where posting QDeferredDeleteEvent and appending touch
+    events are different.
+    If touch events are handled first, there is no problem because the device which is used for
+    these events is registered. However if QDeferredDeleteEvent for deleting the device is
+    handled first, this may cause a crash due to using unregistered device when processing touch
+    events later. In order to prevent processing such touch events, check a device which is used
+    for touch events is registered when processing touch events.
+
+    see QGuiApplicationPrivate::processTouchEvent().
